This README provides a brief overview of the entities, repositories, and usage instructions for the Spring Data entity with one-to-one and one-to-many relationship examples. Customize it further based on your project's specific details and requirements.

# Spring Data

This project implements a few simple entity relationships using Java JPA entities and Spring Data repositories.

## Entities

### Project

The `Project` entity represents a project in the system. It has a one-to-one relationship with a `Manager` and a one-to-many relationship with a list of `Staff`. 

@Entity
public class Project {
    // Fields and annotations...
}

### Manager
The Manager entity represents a project manager in the system. It has a one-to-one relationship with a Project.

```
@Entity
public class Manager {
    // Fields and annotations...
}
```

### Staff
The Staff entity represents a staff member in the system. It has a many-to-one relationship with a Project.

```
@Entity
public class Staff {
    // Fields and annotations...
}
```

## Spring Data Repositories
### ProjectRepository
The ProjectRepository is a Spring Data repository for the Project entity. It provides basic CRUD operations and can be extended with custom queries.

```
public interface ProjectRepository extends JpaRepository<Project, Long> {
    // Additional query methods can be added here if needed
}
```

### ManagerRepository
The ManagerRepository is a Spring Data repository for the Manager entity. It provides basic CRUD operations and can be extended with custom queries.

```
public interface ManagerRepository extends JpaRepository<Manager, Long> {
    // Additional query methods can be added here if needed
}
```

### StaffRepository
The StaffRepository is a Spring Data repository for the Staff entity. It provides basic CRUD operations and can be extended with custom queries.

```
public interface StaffRepository extends JpaRepository<Staff, Long> {
    // Additional query methods can be added here if needed
}
```

## Usage
